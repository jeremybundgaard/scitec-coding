-This code as developed using python 3.6 and requires only numpy and matplotlib
-Download  python installer https://www.python.org/downloads/
-once python is installed use the CLI (command line interface) or terminal
 to run `pip install matplotlib numpy`

USAGE
-via CLI change directories to the scitec-coding/lla-ecef/ folder
-run: `python SciTec_code_problem.py`
-Info of the scripts actions/progress are output (stdout) to the CLI.
-Two plots are generated to graphical demonstrate the velocity interpolation
